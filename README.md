# times-table-tester

Google Chrome Extension Version

Small web app to test times tables knowledge, uses html, css and javascript.
The design of the app relates to the intention of releasing it as a Chrome extension when more features are added.
Currently 2 modes exist: free practice, and 3 minute time limit.
User can choose which table to practice via a dropdown (times tables 2 to 12 or 'All' for random selection).

** UPDATE 06/02/2021 **
1, Some UI changes
2, Added colour changing progress bar to timed test, progress bar fills as time decreases,
changing from green to orange at 50% time remaining, and from orange to red at 10% remaining.
3, Added IndexedDB database to app, with results saved after successfully completing timed test.
